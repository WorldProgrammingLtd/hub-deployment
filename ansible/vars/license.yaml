# SLC License:
#
# Here you can chooose AltairOne (a1) or ALM licensing (alm); if you have an
# on-premise licensing server.
#
# * For a1 you need to supply an "auth code" generated from https://altairone.com
#   and the ansible will generate an anyhost "auth token" for you:
#   (e.g. $> $SLC_PATH/bin/almutil -a1auth -anyhost -code XXXXXXXX)
#   Note: the "auth code" is only needed for the first run, after which the
#   generated "auth token" is automatically found from your existing installation.
# * For alm licensing you need to supply the license path to your ALM server
#   instance in the format:
#   PORT@HOST e.g. 6200@almserver.example.com
#
license:
  # For Altair Units:
  type: a1
  auth_code: "XXXXXXXX"
  # Alternatively, for License Manager:
  # type: alm
  # license_path: "6200@almserver.example.com"
